Specificities to install Kadath on mesopsl :

1) Charge the follwing modules
module load gcc/7.1.0
module load openmpi/2.1.0-gcc-7.1.0

2) Need to install locally (using the sources)
 - fftw-3.3.8
 - scalapack (in this case try to also recompile blas and lapack)

3) As usual copy CMakeLocal.cmake.mesopsl to CmakeLocal.cmake
and change the paths to the local libraries (fftw and scalapack)

4) Change cmake -> cmake3 in install_par

5) Launch install_par

Good luck...
