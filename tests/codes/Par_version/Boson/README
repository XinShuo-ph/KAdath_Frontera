Code used in the paper : Phys. Rev. D, 90, 024068 (2014)

FILES :
**********************************
init.cpp 
	Computes a boson star from an analytic initial guess. Setting the various parameters to ensure convergence may be tricky.
	Produces a result file "bosinit.dat"

************************************
sequence.cpp
	Computes a sequence of boson stars, varying the omega parameter, starting from one already computed configurations.
	One should call "sequence conf.dat", where conf.dat contains the initial configuration.
	The various configurations are called "bos_*_*.dat" where the *s are the winding number k and the omega parameter.

***********************************
reader.cpp 
	Enables to read an output file and prints various global quantities. One should type something like : "reader bos.dat" where bos.dat contains the configuration to be read
	This is not a parallel code
