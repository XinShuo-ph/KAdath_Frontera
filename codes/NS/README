The following documents the basic use of the 3D single neutron star solver included here.

The code base consists of the following codes handling single neutron stars solved in 3D using the XCTS system of equations
together with the first integral of the Euler equations either for the non-rotational (i.e. TOV) or rigidly rotating case

  1) setup.cpp
  2) reader.cpp
  3) solve.cpp
  4) increase_resolution.cpp

Each dataset, regardless of the code used, will consist of two files: 
  <filename>.info, <filename>.dat.

The <filename>.info is the configuration file that both documents important parameters, but also steers the various codes.
This will be discussed in more detail in the relevant sections below.  The configuration file is currently implemented using
BOOST python trees using their propretary INFO format.  Details on the implementation can be reviewed in the source files
contained in: 
  $HOME_KADATH/include/Configurator/

The configurator uses meaningful array indexes which are defined in 
  $HOME_KADATH/include/Configurator/config_enums.hpp
  $HOME_KADATH/src/Utilities/Configurator/config_enums.cpp

This allows for easily extending the index capabilities while not impacting the underlying algorithms within the Configurator.
Within the configuration file, the "initial" stores the starting setup of the BH for book keeping purposes only.
Changes to the initial data are done in the BH section below the initial section.

The associated <filename>.dat file contains the numerical space and its domain decomposition as well as the fields defined
in this space, both constructed by means of the Kadath library.  If one loses the DAT file, the INFO file can be used to
regenerate an initial guess of the dataset using the `setup` code.  However, if one loses the INFO file,
it is not possible to easily reconstruct the dataset, since important parameters are stored in there.

setup.cpp
#########
setup.cpp is used to initialize the numerical space and fields prior to solving the system of equations.  It is highly encouraged
to run this at a low resolution of 9 collocation points before going to higher resolution.  This will be discussed further shortly.

Use of `setup` can be done in two different ways:
  1) Run `setup` without any arguments will result in a basic setup utilizing a cold slice of the TNTYST EOS at beta-equilibrium resulting in a 1.4Msol NS.
  2) Run `setup` with a pre-configured *.info file.
     This will generate an initial setup based on BCO_RES, NC, and RMID for a given EOS. All other settings do not impact the setup code, but will be copied over to the new setup.

The output of `setup` is always 'initns.info' and 'initns.dat' in the local directory.
`setup` will generate an initial guess for the solution by setting a constant density throughout the star, with the value 
everywhere set to the central density based on an input central density (NC) together with the initial estimate for the NS 
surface of RMID. The spacetime fields are initialized to flat space values.

It is important to note that the solver can be sensitive to the initial guess for the radius of the NS.  The following recommendations should be
considered when using the current release:
  1) The radial guess (RMID) should be less than the expected radius, so that the adapted surface is within the star and doesn't start far outside.
  2) Solve a simple setup first (i.e. 1.4Msol irrotational) before attempting a more extreme or uncertain setup.  This will be discussed more later.

# EOS
To change the EOS, one need only update the initial guess for the central density (NC), fixed_radius, and update the EOS type
(Cold_PWPoly or Cold_Table), EOS file, and associated parameters.  See $HOME_KADATH/eos for included cold tables and example polytropes.
Currently, the cold table format used is in lorene units.  Therefore, any table that has been used in lorene should also work with this code.

#########
solve.cpp
#########
`solve` will attempt to find a solution to the system of equations based on an input dataset - either from `setup` or from a previous solution.
It is recommended to start with solutions at low resolution and rerun such a converged solution using the code to increase resolution described below.

`solve` currently consists of the following stages:
  PRE:
    The pre-stage will fixed the surface of the NS to the given radius, RMID, in the configuration file.  The irrotational system of equations,
    those with a vanishing shift, are solved.  In the event of RMID being greater than the true radius, this can lead to an ill-defined enthalpy
    within the stellar domains which predominantly lead to a diverging solution in later stages.  Therefore, it is recommended to choose an estimate
    for RMID well within the final radius idealy from a 1D TOV solver.

  NOROT_BC:
    In this stage, all irrotational equations are solved consistently while allowing the outermost stellar domain to adapt to the stellar surface
    determined by the vanishing of the logarithmic specifc ethalpy.
    This code allows to either fix the ADM mass and compute the resulting baryonic mass or vice versa. To do so, one need only steer mb_fixing
    control in the INFO file.

  TOTAL_BC:
    In this stage, the full system of equations is solved together with a finite shift.  
    The implementation is based on rigidly rotating stars together with boundary conditions on either a fixed ADM mass (MADM)
    or fixed baryonic mass (MB) if the the sequence control (mb_fixing) is set to yes.
    
Once a solution has been obtained for a given stage, the previous stages do not need to be reran for iterative changes.
For instance, if we run:
  solve initns.info ./out/

using PRE and NOROT_BC, we can make iterative changes to MADM to obtain additional TOV solutions by only running the NOROT_BC stage.
Likewise, if one is interested in a rotational solution, one can ignore the PRE and NOROT_BC stages and run only TOTAL_BC with
different values of CHI to obtain rigidly rotating solutions iteratively. Stages are disabled by default during the solving routine to reflect this.

NOTES:
1) An output directory can be specified.  This is optional, but recommended since solutions with the same MAD, CHI, and resolution will have the same
   filename regardless of the EOS employed to minimize the filename size
2) In the event a rotational solution does not fully converge, this can sometimes be attributed to a non-ideal domain decomposition.  In this event,
   on can take one of the checkpoints (e.g. rot_3d_total_bc4.info) and run it through `increase_resolution` without actually changing the resolution.
   This will result in a more optimal domain decomposition and may solve convergence issues when the solver oscillates around 1e-6 to 1e-7 especially
   in situations near the mass shedding and maximum mass TOV limit.
3) On 128 cores, an irrotational NS takes <2min to solve from the default setup.  Adding rotation (CHI != 0) and resolving using
   stage (TOTAL_BC) takes approximately 3min depending on the configuration. 
4) A much more efficient approach for solving the PRE or potentially avoid it altogether would be to employ 
   a 1D- or 2D-TOV solver to create the initial estimates for the hydro quantities and radius of the stellar surface.  
   This is an optimization intended for a future release

increase_resolution.cpp
#########
`increase_resolution` is designed to be able to increase the resolution of a given dataset by using the spectral representation of the fields
and interpolate them onto a domain decomposition with an increased number of colocation points or with different boundary radii.
In this way a fully solved, initially low resolution dataset (e.g. res 9) can be increased in resolution and only ran at high resolution
for the final stage.
The computational domain is also modified slightly based on the min and max values of the NS surface radius to allow for a non-overlapping
domain decomposition. As noted in the section discussing `solve`, this can be used to simply reinterpolate the solution onto a new domain
decomposition in the scenario when a low resolution isn't converging fully (i.e. oscillates around 1e-7).

By running
  `increase_resolution <filename>.info <new_base_name> <res>`
it will result in the generation of <new_base_name>.<info/dat> dataset with a new resolution of <res>.

Again, one only needs to rerun the last stage of the solver if it was solved at low resolution beforehand (e.g. NOROT_BC, TOTAL_BC, etc).

#########
reader.cpp
#########
`reader` is just a basic reader that prints out useful information that is obtained from the system of equations. The vast majority of the output values 
are calculated (i.e not pulled from the configuration file) and are meant to serve as a way to determine the valididity of the solution.
This example should give the reader the details to extend the reader to their own diagnostic needs.

#########
Example test case - generating a 1.4MSol NS from scratch using Togashi EOS:
#########
  1) run `setup` to generate the default dataset
  2) run `solve initns.info` - the final solution should be converged_NS_1.4.0.09.<info/dat>
  3) run `reader converged_NS_1.4.0.09.info` to see interesting diagnostics

#########

  5) run `increase_resolution converged_NS_1.4.0.3.09.info initns 11`
  6) run `solve initns.info` - the final solution should be converged_NS_1.4.0.3.11.<info/dat>
